# 📄 English → Hindi Translator (with OCR)

This is a learning project built to explore **Python deployment** and understand how apps run on the web using **Render**.  
It translates uploaded **DOCX, PDF, or Image files** from English into Hindi.  

---

✨ **Key Features**
- Upload a **Word, PDF, or Image file**  
- Automatic translation from **English → Hindi**  
- Supports scanned PDFs/images via **OCR (pytesseract)**  
- Download the translated DOCX file  

---

🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) – Web UI  
- [deep-translator](https://pypi.org/project/deep-translator/) – Translation  
- [pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) – OCR  
- [pdf2docx](https://pypi.org/project/pdf2docx/) – PDF → DOCX  

---

🚀 **Deployment**
- Hosted on [Render](https://render.com/)  
- Connected directly with GitHub for automatic redeploys  

---

⚠️ **Note**  
This was created as a **fun project** to learn the technical workflow of:  
1. Writing a Python app  
2. Managing dependencies with `requirements.txt`  
3. Pushing code to GitHub  
4. Deploying with Render  

It’s not a polished production app — just a showcase of how Python apps can be deployed! 🎉
